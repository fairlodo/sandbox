  // The function translates the string like 'my-short-string' to MyShortString

  // 1. Break the string into separate words using - as a delimiter
  // 2. Capitalize each word
  // 3. Concatenate in a single word
  // 4. Return result

  // NB: There is a better solution of which I didn't know:
  // it operates functions with a dot in a same query. First dotted function
  // is a string function, and then it continues with an array functions.
  // The sequence is split - map

          .map((word, index) => index == 0 ? word : word[0].toUpperCase() + word.slice(1))
          .join('');
  }

  // Okay it seems I got it now. Complicated as fuck, but in the end it appears simple,
  // I just need to be proficient with more methods
  console.log(camelize('-div-width-horizontal'));
